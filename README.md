# Power BI Solutions – Employee Data Analysis

This branch contains my Power BI project (`.pbix` file) where I have applied **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques** to solve specific business questions related to employee data.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to transform raw employee data into meaningful insights by:
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset
- Performing targeted analysis without pivoting
- Designing clear and interactive visualizations

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
1. Removed duplicate entries to ensure accuracy.
2. Handled missing or inconsistent data values for reliability.

---

## 🔎 Data Analysis (No Pivoting)
1. **Travel Analysis** – Calculated total kilometers travelled by employees across categories.  
2. **Sales Team Profile** – Counted employees in the Sales team, bifurcated by gender.  
3. **Department Wages** – Computed average daily wage for each department.  
4. **Top Earners** – Identified the top 5 earning employees, along with their gender and education field.  
5. **Department Trends** – Highlighted patterns in employee allocation across departments.

## 📈 Data Visualization
1. Designed charts/graphs to represent employee data and identified trends.  
2. Selected the most suitable chart types for each analysis:
   - Bar charts for departmental comparisons  
   - Pie charts for gender distribution  
   - Line charts for travel kilometers  
   - Tables/cards for top earners  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query for data cleaning**
- Custom measures and calculated columns

---

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Clear departmental wage differences and allocation trends  
- Gender distribution within Sales team  
- Identification of top performers by earnings and education background  
- Travel patterns across employee categories
